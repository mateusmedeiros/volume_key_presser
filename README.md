## What??

This is the smallest WinAPI program you will ever see.

I quickly threw it together to circumvent the fact that the last available
DS4Windows as of now, which was the last before Ryochan7 retired, when used
with Ryochan7's own FakerInput, appeared to not recognize my "multitouch +
L2/R2 Full pull" commands anymore.

From what I could tell after some back and forth, it was the VolumeDown and
VolumeUp commands that didn't work. Doing it through the old macro system also
didn't work.

So I made a very simple binary to call with the "launch a program" option.
